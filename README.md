CSS Practice
======

Move along.  Just playing around with CSS Patterns I learned while watching freely available videos of CSSDay.io 2015.

In particular I'm playing around with

* Zero Global Style

* Styling Components -vs- Using Components for Style

Practice With Me
=======

* git clone git@github.com:jrhicks/csspractice.git

* cd csspractice

* npm install

* npm run start

Dream With Me
========

I guess I'm doing more than just practicing.  I'm also dreaming up the target code a "dream generator".  My dream is to quickly setup a project and then generator UI.

* npm install rpt

* rpt new PlayApp

* cd PlayApp

* npm install

* cd app/views/_Dashboard

* rpt g HeroPanel Main
