Thanks to Babel (formerly 6to5) a clear winner has emerged in the
[ES6 compiler/polyfill arena ](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) This tool is mature and easily integrates with your favorite build environment: Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, RequireJS, Browserify and more.

* [JSCS Overview](http://jscs.info/overview.html) - Links to many *friendly packages* for common editors such as Atom, Sublime, WebStorm.
