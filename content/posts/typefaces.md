Serifs are small lines tailing from the edges of letters.  Fonts with these are classified as Serifs.  Fonts without these strokes are classified as Sans-Serif.  (Sans meaning without).

Styles range from emulating classic calligraphy and features produced from old style hand writing (humanist) to increasingly abstract and geometric.

Serif Font Selection
==========

* Humanist Serif (old style) - Journalism & Historical

* Transitional Serif - Academia & Legal

* Modern Serif - Arts & Culture

* Egyption (slab) Serif - Authoritative, yet friendly - Marketing & Promotional

Sans-Serif Selection
==============

* Humanist Sans-Serif - Government, Educational, Finance

* Transitional Sans-Serif - Technology & Transportation

* Geometric Sans-Serif - Science & Architecture


Pairing Fonts
============

A single typeface is okay and ideal for the "beginner".  But if you must pair two fonts focus on contrast.  Be sure they don't clash.  You can do this by assuring you don't pick two different fonts from the same classification (Serif, Sans).

This pairing would be okay.

* Headings in Humanist Serif

* Body in Humanist Sans-Serif

These would be a bad

* Headings in Humanist Serif

* Body in Egyption Serif
