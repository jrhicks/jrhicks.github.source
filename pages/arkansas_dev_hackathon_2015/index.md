[Arkansas Dev](http://www.arkansasdev.com/) held the 2nd Hackathon at the [The Venture Center](http://www.venturecenter.co/).  In this post I try to:

* Collect Some Event Buzz

* Start a Twitter Directory

* Link to Stuff I talked about

Please comment below with stuff you saw and heard and any attendees on twitter I missed.  Thanks!

Event Buzz
========

* [Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com/) - The stunningly fast micro-framework by Laravel.

* [LR .Net User Group](http://lrdnug.org/ ) - Paul Gower worked on the lrdnug website which changed it's platform from ASPNET MVC to github pages and jekyllrb for ease of use.

* [Little Rock MongoDB User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Little-Rock-MongoDB-User-Group/) - This group is a place for developers to learn more about the open source, JSON-based document database MongoDB. MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database and more people are adopting MongoDB everyday. So if you are facing challenges with MySQL, Postgres or Oracle and want to explore a more flexible, scalable alternative, please join us at one of our user group meetups. Our meetups typically consist of some pizza, networking and a presentation on MongoDB.

* [Python Artists Of Arkansas](http://www.meetup.com/Python-Artists-of-Arkansas) - Whether just curious, a new programmer, or you remember clearing the moths out of your vacuum tubes, we want to see YOU! Primarily about the Python programming language, we want to encourage all "programming" and "technology" discussions - COME GEEK OUT!

* [Gimbal](http://gimbal.com/?gclid=CLqUmOS8gsUCFVY8gQodl6QABA) - The Gimbal platform combines advanced geofencing and analytics, the largest deployment of industry-leading BluetoothÂ® Smart (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons, and unmatched security features and privacy controls to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

* [iBeacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) is a new technology described by Apple Inc. as "a new class of low-powered, low-cost transmitters that can notify nearby iOS 7 or 8 devices of their presence."[1] The technology enables a smart phone or other device to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon.[

* [PWM signal with msp430](http://hanixdiy.blogspot.com/2015/04/msp430-setting-up-clock.html)

* [CARL Bot](http://www.katv.com/Clip/10628256/maker-faire-carl-bot)

* [MakerBot](http://www.makerbot.com/) - Powerful 3d printing

* [Arkansas Robotics League](http://uark.edu/rso/uarc/) - Our organization aims to design, build, and test robots and automated machines through collaboration between the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciples.

* [React PHP](http://reactphp.org/) - Event-driven, non-blocking I/O with PHP.

* [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) - Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.  Also see -  [Hydra](http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/)

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - An open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins.

* [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information. AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests.

* [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) - Computer Vision platform using Python

* Keyboards - Over 3 folks had brought nice tactile keyboards including the [Matias Tactile Pro](http://matias.ca/tactilepro/)

* Sean Townsend was hacking on a retro shooter game for Android and iPhone.
