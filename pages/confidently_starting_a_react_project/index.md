The Paradox of Choice
=====

The Paradox of Choice - Why More Is Less is a 2004 book by American psychologist Barry Schwartz. In the book, Schwartz argues that eliminating consumer choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers.

> Autonomy and Freedom of choice are critical  to our well being, and
> choice is critical to freedom and autonomy. Nonetheless, though   
> modern Americans have more choice than any group of people ever has
> before, and thus, presumably, more freedom and autonomy, we don't seem
> to be benefiting from it psychologically.

>â€‰quoted from Ch.5, The Paradox of Choice, 2004
