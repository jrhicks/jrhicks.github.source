##About Me

I'm a developer who tweets at <a href="https://twitter.com/jrhicks">@jrhicks</a>.  I blog about things
I'm trying to learn.  I'm a practicing 4DX coach, family guy, and I enjoy chess, bicycling, and health topics.

I work at <a href="htttp://www.cteh.com">CTEH LLC</a> where I've been developing and maintaining a suite
of Ruby-On-Rails applications for Emergency Response Management and readyness.  These applications are not
public facing so I've attempted to collect my public works below.

## 4DX Coach

###At CTEH

<img src="cteh.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">

Under executive guidance and professional consulting from Franklyn Covey, I'm part of small
coaching team that help 30+ teams execute consistently on their most important goals.

###Acorn Hours

I met with Acorn Hours CEO at barcamp Little Rock and helped him set his goals and leads.  A small
personal scoreboard was created after our 2nd meeting.

###Lawson And Company

I've met with with Lawson and Company 3 times to introduce 4DX and help them develop their
Lead and Lag Mesaures.  On the 3rd meeting they finalized their lead measures, crafted the
 best physical scoreboard I've ever seen - and practiced holding weekly WIG sessions.

##Family Guy

###Our Family

We live in Maumelle, Arkansas.  On weekends we like to grab lunch and enjoy the weather.

###Lili

This is Lili and me a few years ago at Seagrove Beach.  We've been together since the summer of 1999 and
still going strong.

###Ava

Our world revolves around Ava.  In this photo she is doing a cheer pose and is pretty excited about
casual-day at school.


## Hobbies

You can find me on Chess With Friends, riding my bike around the Little Rock river trail, or spouting off some diet trivia I've recently read.  I like to program to
